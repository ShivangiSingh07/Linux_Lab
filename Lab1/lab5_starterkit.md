 Q2. Why is automation useful in DevOps?

 solution:
*  Speed and Efficiency: It significantly increases speed and efficiency, delivering
 software faster with less manual effort.
 
* Reduced Errors: Automated processes execute consistently, minimizing human
 error and inconsistencies that often arise.
 
* Focus on Innovation: Automating routine and labour intensive tasks allows
 development teams to spend more time on strategic work, coding and innovative
 feature development.
 
* Lower Risks: Early detection of bugs and issues through automated testing lowers
 the risk of problems and errors during deployment
