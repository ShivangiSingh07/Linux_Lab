EXPLANATION:
🔸 This script cointains a program having conditional statements (if-else) . 
🔸 I have taken a variable "num" and have assigned value 10 to it. 
🔸 This program will check whether "num" (value assigned to it is 10) is greater than 5 or not. 
🔸 If the condition is true, it will print "No. greater than 5". 
🔸 Else it will print "No. less than 5"

```bash

Extra Questions
 Q1. What is the purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of a script?
Ans. The purpose of #!/bin/bash at the top of the script is:
 1. To specify the interpreter that should be used to execute the script.
 2. It ensures that the script is executed by the intended shell (Bash) even if the user's
 default interactive shell is different.
 3. It also allows the script to be executed directly as a command (if it has execute
 permissions).

 Q2. How do you make a script executable?
 Ans. To make a script executable:
 1. Add a shebang or hash-bang line i.e. #!/bin/bash, at the very beginning of the
 script.
 2. Use chmod command to add execute permissions to the script file.
 3. Once the execute permisssions are set, run the script from the terminal
