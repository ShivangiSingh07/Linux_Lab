 ### How the script works?
  üî∏ The script backup.sh creates a folder named as 'backup' if it doesn't already exists.

  üî∏It generate a timestamp in the format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS .
 
  üî∏It then loops through all '.txt' files in the current directory.

  üî∏ Each '.txt' file is copied into the backup folder with the timestamp appended to the filename,   just before the '.txt' extension.

   * Example Run:

  üî∏ I created two text files by executing the given commands in the   terminal:
   echo "Hello LInux" > file1.txt
   echo "Backup Test" > file2.txt

   * Command to run the script backup.sh: ./backup.sh
   * Command to verify the backup files in the backup directory: ls backup/
 
 ```bash
 Output
 ```

  Extra Questions

 Q1. What is the difference between cp, mv, and rsync?

 Ans. 
 * `cp (copy)`:-It duplicates files and directories.-It creates a new copy of the source files or directories at a specified destination, leaving
 the original untouched.
 *  `mv (move or rename)`:-It moves or renames files or directories.-Relocates the source file or directory to a new location, deleting the original one from
 the previous location.
 * `rsync` (remote synchronize):-Synchronizes files and directories, often between local and remote locations, but also effectively locally-Its key advantage is efficient incremental transfers.


 Q2. How can you schedule scripts to run automatically?

 Ans.
 * You can schedule scripts to run automatically by using cron . It is a time based job
 scheduler.
 * It allows you to schedule tasks to run automatically at specified intervals or time.
